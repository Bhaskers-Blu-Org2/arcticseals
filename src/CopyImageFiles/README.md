# CopyImageFiles

This is a Windows GUI tool to simplify copying or moving arctic seals image files in some source folder (in arbitrary sub-folder structure) into a target folder as a flat list of files. Allows filtering by survey date and image type (color vs. thermal).

Open `CopyImageFiles.sln` in Visual Studio to build and run.
